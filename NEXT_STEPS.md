Key Changes Made:

🔑 Core Profile Elements:

- User info card now displays first name and email (instead of dream stats)
- Clean, simplified layout removing the stats grid

⚙️ Minimal Settings (Subscription-Focused):

- Manage Subscription - Deep links to App Store/Play Store subscription
  management
- Restore Purchases - Full implementation with loading indicator and feedback
- Delete Account - Proper confirmation flow for account deletion

🎨 Optional Additions:

- Theme Toggle - Light/Dark/System theme selection dialog
- Support - Opens email client with pre-filled support email
- Privacy Policy & Terms - External links (you'll need to update the URLs)

✅ Technical Implementation:

- Added url_launcher dependency for external links
- Fixed user email access (was using wrong Clerk API property)
- All handlers properly implemented with error handling
- Maintained existing animations and styling consistency
- Cleaned up unused imports

The screen now has exactly 4-5 core items as suggested, feels clean and
uncluttered, but handles all the essential functionality needed for a
subscription-based app. The layout focuses on subscription management while
keeping the beautiful design aesthetic of your app.

You'll want to update the placeholder URLs for privacy policy and terms of
service when you have them ready.
